About:
  .mes Editor is a program to be used 
  for editing the .mes files from the
  game Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life
  for the Nintendo Gamecube. The
  purpose behind this is to eventually
  release a patch for AWL that fixes
  the many translation errors that
  Nasume is so famous for.
  This program may also work for
  Harvest Moon: Another Wonderful Life.
  
Usage:
  Simply run mesEditor.exe, and choose
  'Open' from the File menu. Select the
  .mes file you wish to open. Using the
  dropdown you can browse through the
  messages in the file. Editing is not
  yet supported.
